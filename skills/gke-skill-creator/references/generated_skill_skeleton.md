# <Issue Name> Expert

## Symptoms

- [Symptom 1]
- [Symptom 2]
- [Specific Error Message/Code]

## Prerequisites

List any specific permissions, tools, or cluster state required before
proceeding.

- [e.g., Cluster admin permissions]
- [e.g., `kubectl` version >=1.x]

## User Intent & Execution Rules

- **Explain/Investigate**: If requested, only explain or diagnose. Do not
  execute modifying commands.
- **Fix/Resolve**: If asked to fix the issue, actually execute the commands to
  apply the fix rather than just listing them.

## Diagnosis (Pre-flight Checks)

Instructions for the agent to run specific read-only commands to verify the
cluster is in the expected state.

1.  Run `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>` to check status.
2.  Run `kubectl describe <resource> <name>` to look for events.
3.  Check logs using `kubectl logs <pod>`.

## Fix (Remediation)

Step-by-step raw `kubectl` or `gcloud` commands to perform the necessary
actions. _Note: Every command block MUST be preceded by a brief description of
its impact and a short rationale explaining why it is needed._

1.  **<Action Description>**:

```bash
kubectl <command>
```

## Verification

Mandatory commands to run to confirm the fix is effective.

1.  Run `kubectl get <resource>` and verify <Expected State>.
2.  Run `kubectl describe` and confirm no further errors.

## Rollback / Cleanup

Steps to undo the changes if the fix fails or causes issues.

1.  **<Rollback Action>**: `kubectl <command to undo>`

## Technical Explanation

A concise explanation of the root cause and why the fix works. [Brief technical
details...]

## Known Limitations and Edge Cases

List any situations where this skill might not work or requires special
attention.

- [e.g., Does not work on Autopilot clusters]
- [e.g., May cause brief downtime]
